# rdfs-sudoku-solver
A sudoku solver that uses a recursive depth-first search algorithm with a tkinter GUI. 

It is capable of finding every valid sudoku board for any given number of starting numbers. If no starting numbers are given, it will generate all possible valid sudoku boards (in theory).   

The search algorithm was written by me based on the concept present in Norvig and Russell's Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach, and later improved by StackExchange's Code Review user Mathias Ettinger. Original post here:
